# GeminiClip
This Python application replicates the "Advanced Pasting" feature from Microsoft PowerToys, offering a free alternative using the Gemini API.  It provides a user interface built with Tkinter and leverages Pyperclip for clipboard management. While Gemini API has request limitations, it is suitable for this specific use case.
